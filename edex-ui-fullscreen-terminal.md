<h1>eDEX-UI – Fullscreen Terminal or Advanced Monitoring Tool</h1>

eDEX-UI is a fullscreen, cross-platform terminal emulator and system monitor that looks and feels like a sci-fi computer interface. Heavily inspired from the TRON Legacy movie effects (especially the Board Room sequence), the eDEX-UI project was originally meant to be “DEX-UI with less « art » and more « distributable software »”. While keeping a futuristic look and feel, it strives to maintain a certain level of functionality and to be usable in real-life scenarios, with the larger goal of bringing science-fiction UXs to the mainstream.

Features:

    Fully featured terminal emulator with tabs, colors, mouse events, and support for curses and curses-like applications.
    Real-time system (CPU, RAM, Swap, Processes) and network (GeoIP, active connections, transfer rates) monitoring.
    Full support for touch-enabled displays, including an on-screen keyboard.
    Directory viewer that follows the CWD (current working directory) of the terminal.
    Advanced customization using themes, on-screen keyboard layouts, CSS injections. See the wiki for more info.
    Optional sound effects made by a talented sound designer for maximum Hollywood hacking vibe.
