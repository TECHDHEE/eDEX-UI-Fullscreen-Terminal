<h1>What is eDEX-UI – Fullscreen Terminal?</h1>

eDEX-UI allows you to run five terminals with full emulation. The default terminal type is xterm-color, meaning it has full-color support. One thing to be aware of is that the keys light up on the keyboard while you type, so if you’re using eDEX-UI on a tablet, the keyboard could present a security risk in environments where people can see the screen. It is better to use a theme without the keyboard on those devices, although it does look pretty cool when you are typing. This is eDEX-UI theme, with htop running in its terminal.

As you can see from the screenshot, eDEX-UI uses quite a bit of CPU (htop shows per core CPU usage, so that’s not the total CPU usage though), but its purpose is not for doing actual work or monitor your system. Its purpose is… to make you look a HACKER. Use it to impress your friends, customize it and post a screenshot on social media, etc. If you need a system information desktop widget, you could use something far more lightweight, like Conky. eDEX-UI supports various customization. You can change the shell (default is Bash on Linux and Mac, and powershell.exe on Windows), the keyboard layout, or run it in windowed mode. Themes are also supported, and the application ships with 8 themes, but you can also create your own theme.
